	<div class="Summary">
		<h2 id="summary:c59a67a3c7bc5faa453847420267045e">Summary</h2>

		<p>I&rsquo;m a programmer who thrives on variation and challenges. One of my primary motivators is learning; I enjoy being tasked with many different tasks that allow me to explore new topics down to the gritty details and find new, simpler ways of solving solutions in that space, and challenge my views on programming.</p>

		<p>I focus a lot on simplicity and API design. I think a vast majority of software is bogged down with complexity that does no  need to be there to solve the problems they are solving. I spend a lot of time considering these topics, trying to recognise complexity and poor API design, and ways of simplifying and improving upon it.</p>

		<p>In my spare time I spend a lot of time reading primarily fiction, though non-fiction books find their way to my shelf regularly. I also spend a lot of time playing games, new as well as old, practicing programming, working on side-projects and ideas, and enjoying nature.</p>

    		<span class="short-description">Engine with Vulkan from scratch</span>
    		<div class="description">
				<p>Leary is my primary side project for learning Vulkan and expanding on my low level programming skills. Everything except for font rasterisation is coded from scratch by hand in a mostly C-like subset of C++, as I find this not only enjoyable but also incredibly rewarding. This also means I am exposed to the many platform specific APIs and quirks.</p>

				<div class="competencies"><p>Vulkan, C, C++, WinAPI, Xlib, custom preprocessor serialisation.</p></div>

    		<span class="title">Sol</span>
    		<span class="short-description">Simple ray tracer in Rust and C&#43;&#43;</span>
    		<div class="description">
				<p>In order to learn and evaluate Rust as a programming language I wrote a simple ray tracer using the language. The same ray tracer was also re-implemented in a simple subset of C++ to act as a comparison for my experience with Rust.</p>

				<p>The project taught me a lot about Rust and ray tracing, and helped me solidify many of my thoughts about Rust and its features as well as programming in general.</p>
