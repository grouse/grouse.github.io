	<div class="Summary">
		<h2 id="summary:c59a67a3c7bc5faa453847420267045e">Summary</h2>

		<p>I thrive on variation and challenges. One of my primary motivators is learning; I enjoy being tasked with many different tasks that allow me to explore new topics down to the gritty details and find new, simpler ways of solving solutions in that space, while working alongside and learning about other disciplines, and challenge my views.</p>

		<p>I focus a lot on simplicity and API design. A far too significant portion of software is laden with unnecessary complexity that results in bugs and awkward, inconsistent behavior that is difficult to track down, while reducing the confidence, productivity, and joy of programmers and users alike. I spend a lot of time considering these topics, trying to recognise complexity and poor API design, and ways of simplifying and improving upon it.</p>

        <p>In my spare time I spend a lot of time reading books of fiction, philosophy, history, sciences, and any other books that catch my eye, as well as playing a wide breadth of video games, and noodling on whatever programming problem I happen to be interested in at the time. I also thoroughly enjoy cooking, and spend far too much time in the cooking section of YouTube.</p>
