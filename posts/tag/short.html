<p>On the rainiest day of the year, Jack was walking home. It was February, so to say it was the rainiest day of the year wasn't saying much, but being February, it was the type of rain that chills you to the bone and makes you consider whether it had intended to be snow, but someone had made a mistake. Ordinarily, Jack liked rain. When it was summer. Or late spring. Autumn rain in particular held a special place in his heart.</p>

<p>But it wasn't autumn. It was February. Jack tried to pretend to like the rain, regardless of how cold it was making him, as a steady stream of droplets made their way from his soaked hair into his eyes. Jack didn't have an umbrella. It's not that he didn't have one with him, he didn't own one. Today, he decided, was the day he'd buy an umbrella. Or rather, tomorrow. Right now, all he wanted was to get home and out of the rain. Tomorrow would be a better day to go to the shops. It probably wouldn't be raining tomorrow.</p>
