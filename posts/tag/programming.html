<p>I'm not a big fan of the destructors in C++. Don't get me wrong, they can certainly be useful. I just think they solve a problem in a way that could've been implemented in a much more powerful way, without the implicit changes in behaviour or performance characteristics that adding a destructor comes with. I'm also not at all a fan of non-trivial code hidden away in destructors that I wasn't expecting, but that's primarily a programmer error.</p>

<p>I wrote my own site generator, it's called fsg. The s and g stands for Site Generator. I'll leave it to the creativity of the reader to figure out what the f stands for. It took a weekend. It's written for myself and by myself, so it doesn't have many bells and whistles, but it does what I need.</p>

<p>Fast iteration times on large projects is often cited as one of the primary reasons to incorporate a scripting language, such as Lua, Python or JavaScript, into the project. The primary downside to this is overall complexity, performance, maintenance, and debugging. So wouldn't it be great if we can get the benefits of scripting languages with none of, or close to none of, the downsides?</p>
