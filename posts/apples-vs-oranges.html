<p>Comparing apples to oranges is one of society's greatest unsolved mysteries. So many people have tried and failed that it has given birth to the idiom "comparing apples to oranges" as a way of saying that something is incomparable.</p>

<p>Not daunted by the failure of civilisation for thousands of years before me, and fueled by the random, racing thoughts of insomnia, this is my humble attempt to crack the problem, once and for all.</p> 



<p>According to folk wisdom, an apple a day keeps the doctor away. As such, I'd recommend apples to anyone with a phobia for white robes or who wishes to avoid persons with doctorate titles in their twitter display name.</p>

<p>The skin of an apple can easily get stuck in your teeth. This is very uncomfortable for anyone, but for someone with dentures or braces it may ruin the experience altogether. For the dentured people, I instead recommend oranges. Provided that they have access to a young person to peel their oranges, as peeling an orange requires a grip strength often not present in the very old.</p>

<p>Oranges are a well known remedy for scurvy. If you're planning an extended voyage at sea, pack a few barrels of oranges. Also consider bringing a few rugby balls to stave off loneliness.</p>

<p>Peeling an orange can also prove a squirting hazard of acidic liquid that, if it gets in your eyes, can be very painful. I suggest wearing protective eyewear at all times when peeling or consuming oranges.</p>

<p>When consuming an orange one has to be constantly on the look out for seeds. Although our modern oranges often have very few or zero seeds, an unexpected rogue seed can not only be particularly unpleassant, it may prove a choking hazard which could drastically lower the life expectancy of the subject.</p>

<p>Oranges, being orange, has a much higher contrast to the surrounding environment compared to apples, which are usually green and disappear in grass or yellow-red which disappear in leaves. If you are worried about losing your fruits, or have a sadistic parent who are trying to ruin easter by hiding fruits instead of sweets, oranges should be your fruit of choice.</p>

<p>A dropped apple quickly develop discoloured blemishes on the skin, hinting at a compromised and mushy piece of apple underneath. The same drop with an orange usually do not develop the same kind of sign of damage on the the outside, but once peeled, might nevertheless reveal damage to the flesh of the orange. However, this damage is usually pretty minor and the orange is usually still good to eat.</p>

<p>When it's all said and done, it seems pretty clear to me that oranges have the upper hand. Unless you're old and lack the grip strength required to peel the orange, in which case you probably want to avoid apples anyway, as avoiding doctors at that stage seems like avoiding the very people still keeping you alive.</p>

<p>Finally, apple juice is far superior to orange juice, and therefore apples are better than oranges.</p>
