<p>I made a stealth game prototype in which you play as a small person in an oversize world where you get to explore the house before stealing the biscuit jar and making your way back to safety.</p>


<p>The game was made as an entry for the Brackey's 2025.2 game jam over the course of 1 week after work hours and is playable in your browser or on Windows and Linux, available at <a href="https://grousejst.itch.io/biskut">https://grousejst.itch.io/biskut</a>.</p>



<p>Rattling around in the back of my mind for a while has been this concept of scale and our perception of it, like when you are a child and everything is huge relative to your own size, but you don't really notice until you've grown older, and realise that the vast expanse of the school yard that you turned into a fantastic battlefield in your mind is barely wide enough to get up to running speed before you reach the other side.</p>

<p>When Biscuit was revealed as the theme for the game jam the idea resurfaced with memories of sneaking biscuits and sweets out of the kitchen cupboard, and so I made a stealth game prototype where you sneak around in your house scaled way past reasonable proportions, avoiding the grown-ups to steal the biscuit jar in the kitchen, before rushing back to the safety of your bedroom.</p>

<p>I was talking about the idea with some friends, and got to remembering some old cartoon shows from our childhood where the main characters were all tiny children, and the adults were only ever portrayed as legs walking around, never seen above the waist. With that, Frank Chao was on board to model and animate a couple legs that end at the waist that would act as the grown ups for you to avoid.</p>

<h1>The Plan</h1>
<p>You spawn in your bedroom on the upper floor, where they're quickly introduced to The Plan, and can start your exploration of the house. Upstairs, you'll likely run into Sentra, walking around between the master bedroom and the bathroom. At this point in the game, the NPCs are friendly and don't start chasing you.</p>

<h1>Exploring the ground floor</h1>
<p>Coming downstairs you're introduced to Kenny, who's a lazy teenager who spends all their time watching TV from the sofa, never moving.</p>
<p>Patrolling downstairs is Sentry, walking around between the kitchen and the bathroom, maybe cleaning up and sorting out the laundry. Kendra is the household's academic, they're walking between the office and sitting room, probably looking for a lost book.</p>
<p>You can spend some time walking around the house, exploring, and learning the paths of the different NPCs before grabbing the biscuit jar.</p>

<h1>Grab the biscuits!</h1>
<p>The biscuit jar is on the kitchen counter top, you will have to do some climbing on a bunch of boxes to get up and gain access to the jar. Once grabbed, the NPCs become aggressive, vision cone lighting up to indicate where they're looking.</p>

<p>You have hopefully spent enough time studying the path of Kendra and Sentry to know how to grab the jar safely and run back upstairs, but will at the staircase run into Kenny, whose lazy behaviour means the staircase is completely blocked! You must somehow bait them away from their comfortable couch before it's safe to run upstairs. And don't forget about Sentra waiting upstairs!</p>

<h1>No biscuits in bed!</h1>
<p>Once in the bedroom you are safe to enjoy your hard earned biscuits in peace.</p>
