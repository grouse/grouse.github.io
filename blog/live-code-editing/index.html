<p>Fast iteration times on large projects is often cited as one of the primary
reasons to incorporate a scripting language, such as Lua, Python or JavaScript,
into the project. The primary downside to this is overall complexity,
performance, maintenance, and debugging. So wouldn&rsquo;t it be great if we can get
the benefits of scripting languages with none of, or close to none of, the
downsides?</p>

<div class="note">
	<span class="title">Note:</span>
	<span class="body"><p>This post is written from the perspective of game development. With that said,
most if not all principles are applicable to any software project of similar
size and complexity.</p>
</span>
</div>


<p>Certainly there are other benefits to a more high level scripting language,
particularly if the rest of the code base is in a rather low level programming
language, such as C or C++. It allows people who would generally not classify
themselves as programmers for their primary skill or interest, like designers,
artists and writers, to put their content into the game and seeing how it works
in practice.</p>

<p>This is not a benefit I&rsquo;m going to put a lot of effort into exploring or
considering, simply because I can&rsquo;t speak for what kind of tangible benefits
designers, artists and the like can derive from a scripting language when looking
at the project as a whole compared to the amount of man hours required to make
a scripting language integration perform well, not to mention that the debugging
facilities for such an integration tend to be far worse than what we have
available for native languages.</p>

<p>So how do we get the fast iteration time of scripting languages using ordinary
C or C++? It turns out, it&rsquo;s actually not that complicated. In fact, most of us
have been only a few steps away from achieving it while doing other things. The
solution is dynamically linked libraries, <code>.dll</code> on Windows, <code>.so</code> on Linux.</p>
// file: foo.c
void foo(int a, int b)
{
	// ...
}

// file: bar.c
typedef void foo_t(int, int);
foo_t *foo = nullptr;

void foo_stub(int, int) {}

void* load_foo()
{
	void *lib = dlopen("foo.so", RTLD_NOW | RTLD_GLOBAL);

	if (lib) {
		foo = (foo_t*)dlysym(lib, "foo");
		// ...
	}

	if (!foo) foo = &foo_stub;
	// ...

	return lib;
}

<p>The above snippet is a simple example of how to dynamically load code at
runtime, the code is written for Linux using <code>dlopen</code> and <code>dlsym</code> functions, the
Windows equivalent is copied verbatim but with the necessary replacements to use
<code>LoadLibrary</code> and <code>GetProcAddress</code> instead of <code>dlopen</code> and <code>dlsym</code>.</p>

<p>So, first of, there are a couple of different things that needs to be done to get
the code base ready to be loaded at runtime. I&rsquo;ve already implemented live code
editing in one of my main hobby projects, Leary
(<a href="https://github.com/grouse/leary">https://github.com/grouse/leary</a>), so I&rsquo;ll be using that as a reference to
describe what needs to be done and how to achieve it.</p>

<h1 id="figure-out-what-to-reload:ccf22ca48757b7e712969eb0241589ec">Figure out what to reload</h1>

<p>The first thing that needs to be done is deciding which parts of the code base
should be loaded at runtime and start making the changes necessary to make it
possible to compile these parts into a <code>.dll</code> or <code>.so</code>. For Leary I wanted as
much as possible to fall in this category. That means initialisation, input
handling, simulation, and rendering.</p>

<h1 id="make-a-few-small-concise-entry-points-to-the-reloaded-code:ccf22ca48757b7e712969eb0241589ec">Make a few small, concise entry points to the reloaded code</h1>

<p>We could simply reload every single function in the code, but that is quickly
going to turn into a nightmare to maintain. Instead, I suggest you provide a
very simple interface to the code that is reloaded with just a few different
functions and move all code behind those, making a concise and easy to maintain
interface between the dynamically loaded code and the main entry point of the
program.</p>

<p>In Leary, I decided to make this interface four functions: <code>game_init</code>,
<code>game_pre_reload</code>, <code>game_reload</code>, and <code>game_update</code>. The purpose for
<code>game_pre_reload</code> might not be immediately apparent, and at the time of writing
this post it actually isn&rsquo;t required for Leary, but it&rsquo;s there so that if
anything relies on other outside state, such as Vulkan driver state, the game
code has a chance to make sure that this state is ready to be reloaded. In the
case of Vulkan, which is the most immediate case it&rsquo;ll be needed for in Leary,
it means I can make sure the graphics device is idle and have finished all its
work before I reload the code and recreate shader, buffer and texture resources.</p>

<p><code>game_reload</code> is called after the game module has been reloaded. The function is
used so that we can pass all the global state that we&rsquo;ve gathered from the
module back to be set accordingly. As you might imagine, the less global state
you rely on the less this function has to be doing.</p>

<p><code>game_init</code> and <code>game_update</code> are fairly self evident. <code>game_init</code> is called
once at program startup to set up the primary state object that it then returns
for the primary program to keep track of across module reloads. <code>game_update</code> is
our single entry point into the module that we call every frame with the game
state object from <code>game_init</code> to perform work.</p>

<div class="note">
	<span class="title">Note:</span>
	<span class="body"><p>In a more traditional input-based program without a non-stalling infinite main
loop traditional to games, you can imagine a fifth function <code>work_available</code>
which would block the main loop in the main program until there are input events
that need processing or we have found in some other way that we need to perform
work.</p>
</span>
</div>


<p>After these code changes the function to load all the game code in Leary off of
the disk looks like this:</p>
#define DLOAD_FUNC(lib, name) (name##_t*)dlsym(lib, #name)

void* load_code()
{
	void *lib = dlopen("/path/to/game.so", RTLD_NOW | RTLD_GLOBAL);

	if (lib) {
		game_init       = DLOAD_FUNC(lib, game_init);
		game_pre_reload = DLOAD_FUNC(lib, game_pre_reload);
		game_reload     = DLOAD_FUNC(lib, game_reload);
		game_update     = DLOAD_FUNC(lib, game_update);
	}

	if (!game_init)       game_init       = &game_init_stub;
	if (!game_pre_reload) game_pre_reload = &game_pre_reload_stub;
	if (!game_reload)     game_reload     = &game_reload_stub;
	if (!game_update)     game_update     = &game_update_stub;

	return lib;
}

<h1 id="coalesce-state:ccf22ca48757b7e712969eb0241589ec">Coalesce state</h1>

<p>If all you do is run the above code in your <code>main</code> entry point once, it should
&lsquo;just work&rsquo;. But that&rsquo;s not why we&rsquo;re here. We want to be able to continuously
reload the code as it changes.</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re not relying on any static variables, global or local, in your code
base, you&rsquo;re in luck. Just make sure <code>game_init</code> returns the primary state
object that you pass into <code>game_update</code> and you&rsquo;re pretty much good to go.</p>

<p>If you do use any static variables you need to understand how static
initialisation works, in particular in regards to dynamically linked libraries.</p>

<h2 id="static-local-variables:ccf22ca48757b7e712969eb0241589ec">Static local variables</h2>

<p>Static variables that are declared locally in function or block scope is
initialised at first execution of that scope. The deinitialisation of the static
variables occurs at program or module exit. Because we&rsquo;ll be reloading the code
continuously we&rsquo;ll be calling <code>dlclose</code> followed by <code>dlopen</code> every time we
reload. Static deinitialisation of all block or function scoped static variables
in the dynamic library will occur at <code>dlclose</code>.</p>

<p>There are a few potential pitfalls with this that we need to take care of. The
first obvious one is if the static variable is being allocated on the heap that
means we end up leaking the memory of that static variable every time we reload
the code. That&rsquo;d be bad. The other pitfall is if the static variable is
initialised by executing some non-trivial code. That <em>might</em> be bad.</p>

<p>There isn&rsquo;t really any simple solution that fits all in this case. You&rsquo;re
just gonna have to go through each static variable and figure out if multiple
initialisations and deinitialisatons of the variable would result in bad
behaviour. As a personal preference, I tend to avoid the type of static
variables that would cause these types of problems for a number of different
reasons, live code editing being just one minor one of them. These reasons may
become the subject of a future post.</p>

<h2 id="static-global-variables:ccf22ca48757b7e712969eb0241589ec">Static global variables</h2>

<p>Static global variables will be initialised with <code>dlopen</code> and deinitialised with
<code>dlclose</code>. Fortunately, these are a lot easier to handle cleanly in our use case
of reloading the module.</p>

<p>Put simply, avoid initialising static variables using function calls, e.g.
<code>static Foo foo = some_foo_init();</code>. Similarly as with the static block and
function scoped variables, these assignments mean that <code>some_foo_init</code> will be
executed every time we reload the module. The same thing applies if the static
variable is used to track state that needs to persist across reloads, as the
reload will reset the state.</p>

<p>Instead, put all these initialisations behind an <code>init</code> or <code>reload</code> function.
In the case of Leary, that&rsquo;s exactly what <code>game_reload</code> is used for. The state
object from <code>game_init</code> is used to store and restore the values of the
variables.</p>

<h1 id="putting-it-all-together:ccf22ca48757b7e712969eb0241589ec">Putting it all together</h1>

<p>At last. We&rsquo;ve coalesced all the state required into a single object that we can
pass into the drastically reduced entry point interface that we&rsquo;ve defined, and
we&rsquo;ve (hopefully) cleaned up all static variables or made sure they all behave
well when being initialised multiple times. It&rsquo;s time to write the main loop
that pulls it all together and reloads the code when appropriate.</p>
typedef void game_init_t(GameState*);
typedef void game_pre_reload_t(GameState*);
typedef void game_reload_t(GameState*);
typedef void game_update_t(GameState*);

void game_init_stub(GameState*)       {}
void game_pre_reload_stub(GameState*) {}
void game_reload_stub(GameState*)     {}
void game_update_stub(GameState*)     {}

game_init_t       *game_init       = nullptr;
game_pre_reload_t *game_pre_reload = nullptr;
game_reload_t     *game_reload     = nullptr;
game_update_t     *game_update     = nullptr;

#define DLOAD_FUNC(lib, name) (name##_t*)dlsym(lib, #name)
void* load_code()
{
	void *lib = dlopen("/path/to/game.so", RTLD_LAZY | RTLD_GLOBAL);

	if (lib) {
		game_init       = DLOAD_FUNC(lib.handle, game_init);
		game_pre_reload = DLOAD_FUNC(lib.handle, game_pre_reload);
		game_reload     = DLOAD_FUNC(lib.handle, game_reload);
		game_update     = DLOAD_FUNC(lib.handle, game_update);
	}

	if (!game_init)       game_init       = &game_init_stub;
	if (!game_pre_reload) game_pre_reload = &game_pre_reload_stub;
	if (!game_reload)     game_reload     = &game_reload_stub;
	if (!game_update)     game_update     = &game_update_stub;

	return lib;
}

void main(int, char **)
{
	void *lib = load_code();

	GameState game = {};
	game_init(&game);

	while (true) {
		game_update(&game);

		game_pre_reload(&game);
		dlclose(lib);
		lib = load_code();

		game_reload(&game);
	}

	return 0;
}

<p>Naturally, reloading the game code every frame is a horrendously bad
idea. It&rsquo;ll tank the performance and you&rsquo;re pretty much asking for trouble.
There are a number of ways to get around that problem: either reload the code
after some predetermined, arbitrary amount of time, or use a way to determine
whether the <code>game.so</code> file has changed and only reload the code when that
happens. To accomplish the latter you can simply query the last modified date of
the file whenever you want to reload it, or you can look into the various
platform specific ways that exist to be notified via callbacks or events when a
file changes. Right now in Leary I simply query the last modified time of the
dynamic library every second and reload it if it has changed.</p>

<h1 id="final-words:ccf22ca48757b7e712969eb0241589ec">Final words</h1>

<p>There you have it. Natively compiled C/C++ code reloaded dynamically at runtime,
allowing you to very rapidly change a piece of code, compile it, and have the
changes immediately take effect in the running program. It&rsquo;s magic.</p>

<p>Some caveats still exist. For example, if the layout of your data changes, by
changing the order of variables in a struct or their type you&rsquo;re going to
have to do a proper full reload of the game. Secondly, as alluded to earlier in
the post, you&rsquo;re going to have to take extra care that any libraries that you
use won&rsquo;t behave badly when reloaded dynamically like this.</p>

<p>Debugging can also be somewhat temperamental at times. Visual Studio in
particular likes to lock both the <code>.pdb</code> and executable files when it&rsquo;s
debugging so that they can&rsquo;t be changed at all, and GDB seems to freak out
somewhat when symbols have changed without it realising.</p>

<p>In the case of Visual Studio&rsquo;s locking you pretty much just have to make sure to
copy the binaries and debug symbols to intermediate copies before you load them,
so that the symbols and binaries being generated by the compiling isn&rsquo;t the ones
you&rsquo;re actually loading.</p>

<p>For GDB&rsquo;s freak out, I&rsquo;ll get back to you on that one. I&rsquo;m sure there are
reasonable solutions to work around it.</p>

<p>These problems have, so far, for me, been rather secondary in priority.
Generally when I want to debug something I&rsquo;m not very interested in being able
to do live code editing, so I have a simple <code>#define</code> to turn it off in favour
of traditional static linking.</p>

<p>As a programmer very comfortable in the low level trenches of C/C++, this then
gives me the best of both worlds. When I need fast iteration testing gameplay I
turn on the live code editing and I just have to compile for my changes to take
effect immediately, when I need to debug I turn it off and I get the stable,
&lsquo;normal&rsquo;, statically linked code that GDB and Visual Studio plays nicely with.
All with none of the massive performance cost of scripting languages or the
immense man hours required for the maintenance.</p>
